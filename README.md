# Open Analog Designer Toolbox (OADT)

## Description

The **Open Analog Designer Toolbox (OADT)** is a software tool aimed at analog designers. It simplifies the process of generating gm/ID curves, facilitating the gm/ID methodology. The tool provides two core functionalities: generating Look-Up Tables (LUTs) for different technologies and creating custom gm/ID curves using these LUTs.

## Installation

To use OADT, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/At139/OADT.git
Ensure the following Python libraries are installed:
PyQt5
numpy
scipy
matplotlib
You can install them using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install pyqt5 numpy scipy matplotlib
Run the application:
bash
Copy code
python main.py
Features

Generate Look-Up Tables (LUTs): Create LUTs for different semiconductor technologies to assist in analog design workflows.
Generate gm/ID Curves: Customize and generate gm/ID curves using the LUTs for various design needs.
