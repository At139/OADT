# Open Analog Designer Toolbox (OADT)

## Description

The **Open Analog Designer Toolbox (OADT)** is a software tool aimed at analog designers. It simplifies the process of generating gm/ID curves, facilitating the gm/ID methodology. The tool provides two core functionalities: generating Look-Up Tables (LUTs) for different technologies and creating custom gm/ID curves using these LUTs.

## Installation

To use OADT, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/At139/OADT.git
   ```
2. Ensure the following Python libraries are installed:
   - PyQt5
   - numpy
   - scipy
   - matplotlib

   You can install them using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install pyqt5 numpy scipy matplotlib
   ```

3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Features

1. **Generate Look-Up Tables (LUTs)**: Create LUTs for different semiconductor technologies to assist in analog design workflows.
2. **Generate gm/ID Curves**: Customize and generate gm/ID curves using the LUTs for various design needs.
